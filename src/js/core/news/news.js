    'I am hoping you can help me.' +
    ' My husband got very sick a few years ago and was in hospital for 23 days on IV antibiotics.' +
    ' As a result of the antibiotics he began to lose his teeth -' +
    ' they were all root canal-ed and crowned but began to break off below the gum line.' +
    'They started getting infected and one by one it spread from tooth to tooth.' +
    ' He ended up back in hospital last year with a very bad lung abscess caused from his teeth.' +
    ' The only solution they had was to pull almost all his teeth. They left 5 or 6 up top' +
    " (I don't know why) and the dentist ordered a partial for the top and a full denture for the bottom." +
    " I'm not sure exactly when the dentist ordered these or from where we wouldn't have gone through the dental office." +
    " I'm guessing that my husband agreed to this while sick and on a lot of pain medication." +
    '</p>' +
    '<p class="animated slideInLeft">' +
    'Needless to say they were terribly made and unwearable.' +
    ' My dental plan at work only covers new dentures once every 5 years.' +
    ' To make matters worse the dentist sold his practice,' +
    " so there isn't anywhere we can complain and try to get replacements." +
    ' My husband eventually lost his last 5 teeth one by one and just had the last one pulled about a month ago.' +
    ' He also had surgery for mandibular tori as well about 4-5 weeks ago.' +
    ' He could never get his bottom denture in at all as the pain was unbearable due to the tori.' +
    " Now I'm hoping you can help him. He has no teeth at all now and can hardly eat anything." +
    " He is so embarrassed he won't leave the house or visit friends." +
    ' Our marriage has had no intimacy because his self-esteem is so low.' +
    '</p>' +
    '<p class="animated slideInLeft">' +
    'My husband suffers with bipolar disorder and' +
    " I'm sure you can imagine how this impacts his mood." +
    " He hasn't worked for 14 years since being diagnosed in 2003." +
    ' His only income is CPP disability.' +
    ' I worked full time as a nurse until I was injured several years back and' +
    ' now only work as a part time unit clerk.' +
    " I just can't afford to put out the money for new dentures." +
    ' I hate to see him in so much emotional pain.' +
    ' His depression is getting worse and' +
    " some days he won't even get out of bed." +
    ' Do you know of any program available to help with the cost?' +
    ' I have scoured the Internet but nothing is available or' +
    " we don't qualify if there is any help." +
    ' Would you be willing to help? Can I pay you monthly?' +
    ' Would you be willing to discount the price at all?' +
    " I hate to ask it is not in my nature but I'm out of options." +
    ' I very much appreciate you taking the time to read this and' +
