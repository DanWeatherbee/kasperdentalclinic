       '<p class="animated slideInLeft">If you are having unusual problems with the fit of your dentures, we have the Sr-Ivocap System Kasper ' +
       'Denture Clinic that is highly recommended. Well-known practitioners have published authoritative' +
       ' articles and reports documenting the superlative quality of SR-Ivocap in terms ' +
       'of precise fit, occlusion, and tissue compatibility. It is a denture processing system that controls' +
       ' the shrinkage of the denture base material during polymerization. ' +
       'The finished denture will be an exact reproduction of the waxed up-denture. It will need very little' +
       ' adjustment and occlusal grinding of the teeth is practically eliminated. The IVOCAP' +
       ' acrylic is completely homogeneous and contains no free monomer. It is therefore ideal for ' +
       'patients who are allergic to monomer or who suffer from Stomatitis Prosthesis ' +
       '(localized burning sensation due to bacterial growth in porous dentures). It is a proven fact ' +
       'that the "end-user", the patient, observes a remarkable improvement in both fit and function. ' +
       'This satisfaction means less stress for both the practitioner and the' +
       ' patient and reduces the adjustment period for the patient to the new denture.' +

       'In studies, dental implants are shown to preserve bone and reduce tissue loss.' +
       ' Eating, speech and laughter can now be performed with confidence. Patients feel better ' +
       'and gain a newfound way of life. The rate of success of implants is over 90%. ' +
