Hello Kasper Team,

I am sending this reassuring email to clarify all things in good spirit. Cool

DEADLINE

  I love  coding so much Tongue out  I did not stop until I was done and
delivered it well before the deadline of two weeks that Jason had requested.
My phone number 250 307 6272 has always been and will continue to be available to you.
Please call when you want me to do something for you, my line is open.

Here is a copy of the original email when the site was complete and I notified you.
Note the date is june 28.
I came in your office to announce we were ready to go and
showed you the site on the same day.

The website was ready the same time and day as my teeth,
I made sure of that fact to honor the agreement and
show good integrity.

It is very detailed and contains all of your important server,
domain, hosting, site information, code, username, password if applicable and
should be kept for your records(this email).
I will always have it as well.

INSTRUCTIONS

I will also set up a site for you to log into and get information and
instructional videos regarding your account, website modification,
server admin, how it was built, what it is running on.
How to clone it to your device or desktop.
How to launch your own server at home on your own pc if you wish to have a dev server for testing.
You could even host it from home or your office, there are many possibilities.
Teaching is another phase of learning what I am studing and
the instructional videos will be beneficial to both of us and future clients.

QUALIFICATIONS

Large companies hire programmers to do this full time at 70 dollars per hour which is my ultimate goal.
Beyond that I have 23 years of computer experience,
two programming certificates, 3 years of modern programming,
configured and run my own dedicated server and
my commitment is 200% to this and all projects I create.

MODIFICATION

I have and am now inviting your team to let me know of any changes
and I will act on them immediately.
I have been waiting for the site assets and design input all this time.
In light of that,
please send everything if you wish to wrap this up.

DESIGN

I took the initiative on some further design after I cloned Northerns site during the idle period of this project.
I see now that was a mistake and will leave the design choices up to you before deployment.
I will clarify that initialy before moving forward with future clients.
I will be more carefull with the interpretation of your emails and confirm I got it right.
The level of detail is immense and is usualy handled by a team of developers (coders, content writers, server-backend developers, etc.),
however I am a Free lance artist in the form of code and future Protype Concepts.
Asset items, design ideas or modifications can easily be misconstrued by both parties or even additional parties involved.

I am learning that sitting down with the client and
designing it together would be the best way to handle the process in the future as my career progresses.
I appreciate the learning experience on business relashonship developemnt.
I am a talented programmer not a content writer and
need some refinement on the business side of things.
I am confident we can work through that together leaving us both happy and
satisfied with what we have created to represent your florishing company and my budding career.

Only 14% of all websites on the internet are responsive and adapt to all devices despite code, os, server,
and screen variations including new devices coming out now like the smart watch and glasses.
Wordpress and other Content Management Systems are bloated.

It comes out of the box unresponsive built in PHP (old language with security issues that requires PHP on the server as well),
needing programmers to convert archaic code to new modern code
and somehow run on a outdated server Stack(bundle of old technologies).

Your website is now part of that 14% and is ultra modern in design using current web technologies and coding practices.
It will run on any type of server without configuration and no other technologies or languages,
frameworks, libraries are required on server side.




Thank you.

Best regards Dan.

Hello Jason and Oley and staff I hope you are having a great day,

        Your Domain name and hosting is free for one year.
        After that goddady requires there yearly domain fee witch is currently about 6 dollars.
        Your hosting on my server would be 10 per month or 90 for a year to help cover my fees.
        Total cost after the free year would be approximately $106.00 per year.

        You will save $1,200 this year alone in just 6 months
        from canceling the yellow pages website and you own it.
        Generally websites are coded at $200.00
        per page minimum to give you an idea of your sites value.

        Here is all the information in the form of snap shots.

        The included Images show;

        Host System Info
        Domain Registrar
        Contact Info for each.
        Code Repository Info
        
        kasperdentureclinic.ca

        Website Downloadable Zip File.

        The entire site can be customized in any way you wish.
        Each edit on the site is cataloged in my repository
        witch means I can roll back to any version all the way to the first change.
        All types of input are welcome.
        I want the site to be exactly the way you want it.
        We can add or remove pages or content.

        The foreign language you see is temp content
        developers use when designing layout without the help of input.
        It is called Lorem Ipsum.

        My Mother has agreed to do a testimonial and before and after picture as will I.
        You can review the material before we publish
        to ensure you like it should you decide to use it.

        If you were to do a small video about business on your phone
        or other device I can add those in instead of using you tube.
        The other videos could be done the same way.
        This way you would not require youtube. Either or both will work.

        Text content about your selves and business we can go over later very carefully
        and make sure it is word and grammar perfect before publishing.

        If you would like admin to your hosting, I can set that up for you.

        I realize you are very busy and I will be available at this email
        when it is convenient for you best regards,

        Your Developer Dan Weatherbee.
