The ability to chew well contributes to overall health and nutrition, as well as improved food enjoyment.<br /><br />Aesthetics; the presence of teeth provide a natural facial appearance. Wearing a denture to replace missing teeth provides support for the lips and cheeks, preventing the collapsed appearance that can often occur after losing teeth.<br /><br />Speech; replacing missing teeth especially the front teeth, patients are better able to pronounce those words containing sibilants or fricatives (sounds that require teeth, i.e. fifty, stilts, or tent).<br /><br />Self-Esteem; patients feel better about themselves when their teeth look great.

However, since the plastic appliance is unfamiliar to your mouth, you may experience excess saliva for 12 to 48 hours as your brain adapts to the new feel of your denture.<br /><br />Lisping, or thick speech can also happen at first as your tongue learns the slightly new positions of your new teeth. With practice this will clear up in a short period of time. A very few patients experience a temporary gag sensation.<br /><br />This may occur during the first few days of denture wear, due to the unfamiliar feeling of the denture on your palate. In the unlikely event that this bothers you for longer a couple of days, adjustments can be made to shorten the palate part of your denture.<br /><br />As the denture settles into place over the first days and weeks of use, you may notice areas of pressure or sore spots. This is normal, and will be corrected at adjustment appointments, until your denture fits as comfortably as possible.<br /><br />It will usually take about 6-8 weeks of wear to become completely used to wearing dentures, so patience is key. Starting with soft foods, cutting food up at first helps to train your muscles to eat with your new dentures.","servicesCollapsibleContainersFaq3":"<section class=\"services-collapse-containers\" id=\"services-collapsible-containers-faq-3\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#services-collapsible-article-faq-3\" aria-expanded=\"true\"><a class=\"cd-faq-trigger\" id=\"cd-faq-trigger-3\"data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#services-collapsible-article-faq-3\" style=\"text-decoration:none;cursor:pointer\"><h2 id=\"services-collapsible-h2-faq-3\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-double-down\"></i> </h2></a><article id=\"services-collapsible-article-faq-3\" class=\"collapse\"><p id=\"services-collapsible-p-tag-faq-3\"></p></article></section>","servicesCollapsibleContainersH2TextFaq3":"What types of denture does Kasper Denture Clinic offer?","servicesCollapsibleContainersPTextFaq3":"We Offer Complete and Partial Dentures<br />Implant and Over-dentures<br />Same Day Reline and Repairs","servicesCollapsibleContainersFaq4":"<section class=\"services-collapse-containers\" id=\"services-collapsible-containers-faq-4\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#services-collapsible-article-faq-4\" aria-expanded=\"true\"><a class=\"cd-faq-trigger\" id=\"cd-faq-trigger-4\"data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#services-collapsible-article-faq-4\" style=\"text-decoration:none;cursor:pointer\"><h2 id=\"services-collapsible-h2-faq-4\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-double-down\"></i> </h2></a><article id=\"services-collapsible-article-faq-4\" class=\"collapse\"><p id=\"services-collapsible-p-tag-faq-4\"></p></article></section>","servicesCollapsibleContainersH2TextFaq4":"I have a denture I do not like.

As your tissues change over the years, you may notice your denture becomes too tight or too loose.<br /><br />Sore spots may develop or the appliance may start shifting in your mouth as you talk and eat. If this occurs there are several things we can do to repair, reline, or replace the denture for you.
